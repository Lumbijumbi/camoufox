## What is this?

This Python library wraps around Playwright's API to help automatically generate & inject unique device characteristics (OS, CPU info, navigator, fonts, headers, screen dimensions, viewport size, WebGL, addons, etc.) into Camoufox.

It uses [BrowserForge](https://github.com/daijro/browserforge) under the hood to generate fingerprints that mimic the statistical distribution of device characteristics in real-world traffic.

In addition, it will also calculate your target geolocation, timezone, and locale to avoid proxy protection ([see demo](https://i.imgur.com/UhSHfaV.png)).

## Installation

First, install the `camoufox` package:

```bash
pip install -U camoufox[geoip]
```

The `geoip` parameter is optional, but heavily recommended if you are using proxies. It will download an extra dataset to determine the user's longitude, latitude, timezone, country, & locale.

Next, download the Camoufox browser:

**Windows**

```bash
camoufox fetch
```

**MacOS & Linux**

```bash
python3 -m camoufox fetch
```

To uninstall, run `camoufox remove`.

## GUI for Playwright Automation

Camoufox includes a graphical user interface for recording and automating browser interactions:

```bash
camoufox gui
```

The GUI provides:
- 🎯 Target URL input
- ⚙️ Configuration options (headless mode, viewport, language, output format)
- 🔴 Record Flow functionality using Playwright's codegen
- 💾 Save and export generated scripts
